# MyDiabetiser summary 
A Web Application implemented using a JAVA EE. The functionality of the site is to provide basic information for a new user of the application, ranging from site usage to tips, diets and “how to” documents. The users are able to input relevant personal data (insulin units, blood sugar levels, etc.) and display this data in diagram form for ease of understanding. In addition, the users are able to get suggestions for how many insulin units to be taken based on previous results and records. They are able to create and save a variety of meals with different ingredients which can be used in the calculation of the number of insulin units to be taken. In addition, there are more general factors that the user may be prompted to input. All of these factors will play a role in determining the final amount of units needed in order for a more accurate insulin prediction. All of the food products and ingredients are grouped in the diabetes food pyramid and stored in the database. Reports are generated on request and displayed in diagram form using JavaScript. The database management system is implemented using SQL. Open-source application server GlassFish4.1 is used to deploy the project. Apache server was used to handle HTTP requests and send them to the Glassfish application server.
